# 🚀 Welcome to Push_Swap! 🚀

## 🧩 About This Project
`push_swap` is a challenging and intriguing algorithm project. It's about sorting data with a limited set of operations in the most efficient way possible. Ready to test your algorithm skills?

## 📚 How It Works
- **Objective**: Sort numbers using two stacks, `a` and `b`, with a set of specified operations.
- **Efficiency**: Aim for the least number of moves to sort the stack.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/daanmlab/push_swap.git
   cd push_swap
   ```
2. **Compile the Program**
   ```
   make
   ```

## 🎲 How to Use
- **Running push_swap**: 
   ```
   ./push_swap [list of numbers]
   ```
- **Using the Checker**:
   To verify the correctness of the algorithm:
   ```
   ARGS="<numbers>"; ./push_swap $ARGS | ./checker $ARGS
   ```
   Replace `<numbers>` with the list of integers you want to sort.

## 🤝 Best Friend Sorting Algorithm
The Best Friend Sorting Algorithm is an innovative approach to sorting in `push_swap`. It's based on the principle of "pairing" elements that are close to their target positions, much like pairing best friends. The algorithm identifies elements that are already near their sorted position and performs optimized operations to minimize movements. This unique approach can lead to more efficient sorting, especially in cases where many elements are close to their final sorted positions.

## ⚙️ Requirements
